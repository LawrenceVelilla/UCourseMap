**An intelligent web application designed to help University of Alberta students navigate course selection, visualize prerequisites, build schedules, and stay on track with their degree requirements.**

Navigating university course requirements, prerequisites, and scheduling can be complex. UniPlanner aims to simplify this process by providing students with a centralized, intuitive, and performant tool. **This project represents a significant evolution from an earlier prototype built with Python/Flask/Beautiful Soup, now leveraging a modern full-stack architecture for improved integration, type safety, and performance.**

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Interactive Course Browser:** Search, filter, and explore UAlberta courses.
- **Dynamic Prerequisite/Corequisite Graph:** Visualize complex course relationships using an interactive graph.
- **Schedule Builder:** Add course sections to a visual timetable and instantly detect time conflicts.
- **"Needed For" Insights:** See which courses require a specific course as a prerequisite or corequisite.
- **Optimized Data Loading:** Utilizes efficient **PostgreSQL Recursive CTEs** for fetching prerequisite graph data, significantly improving performance over traditional methods.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a fast and responsive user experience.
- **(Planned)** Program Requirement Tracking & Validation.
- **(Planned)** AI-Powered Chatbot (RAG) for natural language course inquiries.
- **(Planned)** Automated Data Pipeline for maintaining up-to-date course information.
