This is my UofA course listing flowchart

**To do**
- Add the "One of" text when there are multiple options"
- Add feature where you can build your classes and then show all the required clases you need to take based on the prerequisites
- Add feature where you can press enter instead of pressing search
- Add feature where if you hover over a class int the preqs and coreqs -> it shows that class' preqs and coreqs
