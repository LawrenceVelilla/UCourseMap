In this course, students will clean or otherwise pre-process natural language corpora; develop natural language processing tools; integrate existing tools into an analysis task; and apply computational methods to natural language artefacts to extract information, classify the language within the artefact, identify relationships among artefacts, or identify relationships among elements within an artefact.
