Emphasis will be on reactions catalyzed by chiral transition metal complexes, but non-metal catalyzed reactions and heterogeneous catalysis will be covered. Topics include the general principles of catalysis; mechanisms of common steps in catalytic cycles; rapid pre-equilibrium and steady-state kinetic treatments of catalytic rates; the origins of catalytic selection; and the strategies and principles of new catalyst, ligand, and reaction development. The course will include a survey of common enantioselective catalytic reactions and daily examples from ASAP articles that illustrate the principles and theories being taught in the course.",

The strengths, weaknesses, and complementarity of the techniques used will be examined via case studies on the characterization of real-world nanotechnologies, such as heterogeneous catalysts, surfaces and interfaces in semiconductor devices, organic monolayers on metals and semiconductors, nanotube- and nanowire-based electronics, and biocompatible materials.",
